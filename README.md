# social-network

This is a social network web-app that I built from scratch using Node.js, Mongoose, Angular, Express, and Passport.js. It is technically my first full-stack application, even though I took a break in the middle of developing this to go and learn authentication while building another app, my dynamic blog platform.

Along the journey of building this app, I learned many things and absorbed much of full-stack development's best practices, which will be outlined in a later blog post.

This app(v1.0) currently features the ability to:
-sign in securely and store the user's session in a cookie /n
-request and cancel friend requests /n
-confirm friend requests and become friends with other users
-create posts
-like and comment on posts
-present a dynamic feed to the user showcasing only the posts of the users they follow
-present notifications to the user on a timely basis


More improvements are coming along the way !
